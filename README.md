# My Coffee Analytics

## Objective

An application to store and analyze data regarding my coffee brews. \
This app was born out of my personal need to analyze different variables of a coffee brew, such as the method used, water temperature, grinder clicks, and so on. \
The main idea is, when I have necessary data collected, I'll able to generate data points (with graphs on future improvements) to improve my recipes.

## Development

Basically, I've been developing using Python3.10 with Poetry. \
For database, DuckDb, it's easy, fast and embedded. \
Unit test are being developed with Pytest/Pycov. \
Sphinx for documentation. (TBD)

## About

It's meant to be a simple application, so I developed it with a focus on an intuitive console command interface.
